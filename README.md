#[GUIDE] How to get Snapchat Notifications/Get past "Could not connect" Login Error <br/>

Step 1. Delete any versions of sideloaded/Appstore Phantom/Snapchat <br />
Step 2. Download Snapchat from the Appstore, open & log into your account <br />
Step 3. Download & install iExplorer on computer from www.macroplant.com/â€Ž (You can use the demo) <br />
Step 4. Connect iDevice and navigate to Apps>Snapchat in left sidebar (now you will see a list of files) <br />
Step 5. On your computer create a folder called "Documents"<br />
Step 6. Drag all files from iExplorer>Snapchat into newly created "Documents" folder" <br />
Step 7. Unzip "Snapchat-9.40.1.0-with-phantom-v1.0.3.zip" (downloaded from link above)<br />
Step 8. Copy "Documents" folder to Payload>Snapchat.app <br />
Step 9. Select "Payload" & "iTunesArtwork" with finder (Mac) & click "Compress 2 items" <br />
Step 10. Connect device, & install zip with Cydia Impactor. Open Snapchat. See alert, restart. <br />
Step 11. DO NOT ALLOW NOTIFICATIONS IN THE NEWLY INSTALLED PHANTOM APP! <br />
Done. <br />

Note: You only need to do this once, as long as you never logout. Repeat all steps if this happens. <br />
Do not delete the Appstore Snapchat app, that is where you will get notfications from. (Hacky, I know) <br />
